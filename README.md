# 📱 Tasky – Smart & Personalized Task Manager

Tasky is a Flutter-based mobile app that helps users stay focused and organized with a clean UI, practical task features, and local data storage.  
This project was built during my journey at the Information Technology Institute (ITI) as part of the Flutter module.
